# Tickets
## Story tickets

Use our standard way to set up Vue Storefront and Symfony,
see [Documentation](Documentation.md)/Set up Environments.

* CA-2 Create promo collection

**Description**:

Client should be able to show promo page in separate route. For example
example.com/promo/awesome-offer or example.com/promo/black-friday-offer.

Every promo page url key (URL path segment), title, description, price
and image should be manageable.

> **Note:** Page design optimizations by adding (complex) CSS is not
needed during this assigment.
